<area shape="rect" id="node5" href="$class_geom2d___circle.html" title="Describes a circle in the plane (2D space). A circle is defined by its radius and, as with any conic curve, is positioned in the plane with a coordinate system (gp_Ax22d object) where the origin is the center of the circle. The coordinate system is the local coordinate system of the circle. The orientation (direct or indirect) of the local coordinate system gives an explicit orientation to the circle, determining the direction in which the parameter increases along the circle. The Geom2d_Circle circle is parameterized by an angle: P(U) = O + R*Cos(U)*XDir + R*Sin(U)*YDir where: " alt="" coords="5,304,116,331"/>
