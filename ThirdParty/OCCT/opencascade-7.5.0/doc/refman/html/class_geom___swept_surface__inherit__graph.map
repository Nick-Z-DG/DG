Such a surface is obtained by sweeping a curve (called the &quot;extruded curve&quot; or &quot;basis&quot;) in a given direction (referred to as the &quot;direction of extrusion&quot; and defined by a unit vector). The u parameter is along the extruded curve. The v parameter is along the direction of extrusion. The parameter range for the u parameter is defined by the reference curve.
