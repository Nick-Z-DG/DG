It provides an interface for building BVH tree for some set of entities. Thereby, each iteration of overlap detection is a traverse of BVH tree in fact. To use speed&#45;up hierarchical structure in a custom complex sensitive entity, it is necessary to make that custom entity a descendant of this class and organize sub&#45;entities in some container which allows referencing to elements by index. Note that methods taking index as a parameter are used for BVH build and the range of given index is [0; Size() &#45; 1]. For example of usage see Select3D_SensitiveTriangulation.
